> A JavaScript library to load images progressively

It’s written entirely in JavaScript so it doesn’t depend on 3rd-party libraries like jQuery. It's super small, < 1.2kB when minified & gzipped! It will load the full-size images only when the user browses to that part of the page, saving bandwidth & server requests. It is compatible with all modern browsers. See the [Demo](https://thinker3197.github.io/progressively).

## Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev progressively
```

Alternatively you can use [Bower](https://bower.io/).

```sh
$ bower install progressively
```

Then with a module bundler like [rollup](http://rollupjs.org/) or [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), use as you would anything else:

```javascript
// using ES6 modules
import progressively from 'progressively'

// using CommonJS modules
var progressively = require('progressively')
```

The [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/progressively/dist/progressively.min.js"></script>
```
You can find the library on `window.progressively`.

## Usage

Add a image to your `HTML` file setting the `src` attribute containing the lower quality image (< 20kb for ideal cases) and the `data-progressive` attribute holding the path/url to the high quality image.

```html
<figure class="progressive">
  <img class="progressive__img progressive--not-loaded" data-progressive="img/highQualityImg.png" src="img/lowQualityImg.png">
</figure>
```

And initiate the script.

```js
progressively.init()
```

See [demo](https://thinker3197.github.io/progressively) for examples.

## API

### progressively.init(options)

The `init()` API has a few options

#### throttle
Type: `Number` Default: `300`

The `throttle` is managed by an internal function that prevents performance issues from continuous firing of `window.onscroll` events. Using a throttle will set a small timeout when the user scrolls and will keep throttling until the user stops. The default is 300 milliseconds.

#### delay
Type: `Number` Default: `100` value

The `delay` function sets the timout value for images to start load asynchronously. Ideally it's value should be low.

#### onloadComplete
Type: `Function` Arguments: `None`

The `afterload` function is callback function which executes when all images have loaded. It is fired when all the image elements have the `*--is-loaded` class.

#### onload
Type: `Function` Arguments: `HTMLElement`

The `imgload` function is invoked whenever an image elements finishes loading. It accepts `HTMLElement` as an argument which is the current element that is loaded.

```js
progressively.init({
  delay: 50,
  throttle: 300,
  imgload: function(elem) {
    console.log(elem);
  },
  afterload: function() {
    console.log('All images have finished loading!');
  }
});
```

### progressively.render()

Progressively has a `render()` method that can be used to make progressively poll your images when you're not scrolling. For instance in some case you want to render your images before/widthout scrolling down to the image, you can use `render`.
